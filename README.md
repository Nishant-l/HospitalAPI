                     üè• HospitalAPI
We‚Äôre going to design an API for the doctors of a Hospital which has been allocated by the
govt for testing and quarantine + well being of COVID-19 patients
- ### There can be 2 types of Users
    - Doctors
    - Patients
- ### Actions Doctors can perform
    - Doctors can log in
    - Each time a patient visits, the doctor will follow 2 steps
    - Register the patient in the app (using phone number, if the patient already exists, just
    return the patient info in the API)
    - After the checkup, create a Report
    - Patient Report will have the following fields
        - Created by doctor
        - Status:
         Can be either of: [Negative Travelled-Quarantine, Symptoms-Quarantine,
        Positive-Admit]

        - Date
- ### Actions Patient can perform
    - View all record of a specific patient
